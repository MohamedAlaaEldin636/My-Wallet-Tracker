## Project Structure

- Multi-Module Android Project (by Feature & Layer) inshallah,
inspired by [This Talk (Check Figure at 4:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SwTvzDO0A).

- Note it's better to start your App as a Monolithic App and then when you either notice gradle 
build take longer time OR in a team and you want to make better separation OR in case of a large
project, you can start considering Multi-Module as it comes with it's setup complexity,
However here we started it at the beginning as this is used to practice and to showcase code 
usage with that architecture structure inshallah.
